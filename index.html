This is a strong foundation for a resume. However, the text you provided contains several OCR (optical character recognition) errors and typos that need to be cleaned up before you send it to recruiters.

I have polished the content, corrected the typos (e.g., "F lut,ter" to "Flutter," "Me gatro nix" to "Megatronix"), and formatted it into a professional, industry-standard layout.
